        <p>
            The aeromodeling is one kind of sports, based on the constructing scaled or self-developed mini-aircrafts.
            <br>In some cases models can be made in middle, big and true scale
            <br>In aeromodeling, the aircrafts can be clasified by some categories:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><a href="#ID11">Types</a></li>
            <li><a href="#ID12">Kinds</a></li>
            <li><a href="#ID13">Classes</a></li>
        </ul>
        <h id="ID11">Types of aeromodels</h>
        <p>
            In this paragraph we we'll talk about types of avia-models
            <br> In aeromodeling, there're several types of them:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="#ID111">Gliders</a></li>
            <li><a href="#ID112">Planes</a></li>
            <li><a href="#ID113">Jets</a></li>
            <li><a href="#ID114">Drones</a></li>

        </ul>
        <p> Let's check them out in details</p>

        <h id="ID111">Gliders</h>
        <p>
            This type of models is very polpular for training of pilotage, especially for new pilots.
            <br>This type of models is also requered for the settings of the speed, duratation, hight and other types of gliding records.
            <br> Also there's one special kind of gliders- motogliders.
            <br> Those gliders are equipped by motor, that can be electric or fuel-motor.
            <br> In nowdays, this type of gliders has the most number of highest records in duratetion, hight and distance of gliding.
        </p>
        <h id="ID112">Planes</h>
        <p>
            This is the most popular class of avia-models, due to installation of engines or motors.
            <br> And they have different kinds, that can be set in categories.
            <br> We'll talk about them  below.
        </p>

        <h id="ID113"> Jets </h>
        <p>
            This type of models is also can be set as planes, but...
            <br>This kind of planes is so difficult, fast and heavy, that can't be set in any class of <a target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F%C3%A9d%C3%A9ration_A%C3%A9ronautique_Internationale" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F%C3%A9d%C3%A9ration_A%C3%A9ronautique_Internationale">FAI</a>.

        </p>
        <h id="ID114">Drones</h>
        <p>
            Drones are the kinds of the multirotor R/C models, that equipped with the autopilot and <a target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-person_view_(radio_control)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-person_view_(radio_control)">FPV-camera</a>.
            <br> They can be used in different ways: from the simple flights and racing, until the aerial recording and importaint researches.
            <br> They are also callen the <a target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle">UAVs</a>.
        </p>

        <h id="ID12">Kinds of aviamodels</h>

        <p>
            Previously we have talked about the types of aviamodels.
            <br> But there're more categories of models in every type.
            <br> So, now it's time to see them.
            <br> They're kinds of avia-models. So, let's go on.
            <br> The first step will be making the list of categories:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="#ID121">Kinds of planes', gliders and jets' models</a></li>
            <li><a href="#ID122">Kinds of drones' models</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>And every category has the undercategories. We'll talk about them below</p>

        <h id="ID121">Kinds of planes', gliders and jets' models</h>
        <p>They can be classified by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Forms, placing and number of wings</li>
            <li>Number, placing and types of motors</li>
            <li>Number and forms of fuselages</li>
            <li>Types of tail</li>
            <li>Design</li>
            <li>Types of construction</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <a target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airplane#Propulsion" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airplane#Propulsion"> Here</a> you can <strong>read more</strong> about this classifying

            <h id="ID122">Kinds of drones' models</h>
        <p> And those ones, generally, classified by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Size</li>
            <li>Range of flight</li>
            <li>Numbers of motors(multirotor systems)</li>
            <li>Kinds of using</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            In nowdays more and more drones can be integrated for using in our life's aspects.
            <br>For example, in mail delivery, air taxi, etc.
            <br>You can find more information <strong><a target="http://drons.info/" href="http://drons.info/">here</a></strong> and <strong><a target="https://www.popsci.com/technology/article/2013-03/drone-any-other-name" href="https://www.popsci.com/technology/article/2013-03/drone-any-other-name">there</a></strong>.

        <p>
            That's not everything, that I'd like to share with you.
            <br> As the A.N.Tupolev said, "Knowledge doesn't happen much"
            <br> This means, we have to develop our knowledge day by day.
            <br> But for now, let's go to the next paragraph
        </p>

        <h id="ID02">History of aeromodeling</h>

        <p>
            The history of aviation, generally, began in Ancient Greece, while the mith of Daedalos and Ikarus was created.
            <br> But there's another misterious fact, that the ancient scientist Archytas, maybe, has developed something was looking like the aircraft, the 'peristerion'
            <br><size ="40px">
                <em>But we must not forget, that these are just myths.</em>
                <br> In fact, the history of real aircrafts begins in Medievial Europe, in 850's, when the  Abbas ibn Firnas made a jump in Cordoba, Spain, reportedly covering his body with vulture feathers and attaching two wings to his arms. But this jump wasn't successful due to the primitivity of construction.
                <br>The one more step to the sky were the Chinese kites, that was able to carry humans on some hight.
                <br> And, finally, the giant leaps forward were the flights of <a target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_Lilienthal" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_Lilienthal">Otto Lilienthal</a> and <a target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wright_brothers" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wright_brothers"> Wright brothers.</a>
                <br>After the flight of Wright brothers, the FAI was founded on 14 October 1905, and is headquartered in Lausanne, Switzerland.
                <br>
                <br>And since 1910-1920, the era of aeromodeling begins.
                <br>First, the aeromodels were very simple.
                Before and few years after WWs there were gliders and control line planes.
                <br>But in 1950's and 1960's aeromodelers began to use the radio controlled models.
                <br>And those models were very expencive and difficult in service.
                <br>In nowdays, the aeromodels became so suffisticated, that can be used in many everyday life's aspects by everyone.
                <br>Some of them are even equipped by autopilots.

                <h id="ID03">Importaint information about the design</h>

    <p>
        In our days everyone can project, construct and build an aeromodel
        <br>It's just enough to know some formulas and the method of using them.
        <br>Here we'll talk about them.
        <br />
        <br />First of all, we have to know the <strong>Equation of existence of the aircraft</strong>:
        <br />
        <img src="https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/c7fd805704ed5e37dc5f9388c1e157d5f0811933" alt="Existance" />
        <br /> Here we have:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>m0 is mass of hypotetic aircraft</li>
        <li>ξi is the equivalent mass of element</li>
        <li>m fuselage is the mass of fuselage</li>
        <li>m wing is the mass of wing</li>
        <li>m tail is the mass of tail stabilizer</li>
        <li>m cockpit is the mass of cockpit</li>
        <li>m engines=m en * k en is the mass of all aircraft's engines</li>
        <li>k en is the quantity of all aircraft's engines</li>
        <li>m en is the mass of one aircraft's engine</li>
        <li>m equipage=m eq * k eq is the mass of all equipage</li>
        <li>k eq is the quantity of equipage members</li>
        <li>m eq is the mass of one equipage member</li>
        <li>m fuel system is the mass of the fuel system</li>
        <li>m fuel is the mass of fuel</li>
        <li>m chassis is the mass chassis and landing systems</li>
        <li>m equipment is the mass of avionics</li>
        <li>m cargo is the mass of useful cargo</li>
     </ul>

    <p>
        The second equation is the <strong>Equation of the Lifting Force (LF) of aircraft</strong>
        <br />
        <img src="https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5f275799ab7640e182bbeed55ddc2a0b7b7c2ba5" alt="Lifting Force" />
        <br /> Here we have:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Y is the lifting Force, in  Newtons</li>
        <li>Cy is the <a target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lift_coefficient" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lift_coefficient">queficient of Lifting Force</a></li>
        <li>ρ is the density of air on the altitude, kg/m^3</li>
        <li>v is the airspeed of aircraft, m/s</li>
        <li>S is the wing's square, m^2</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        This is not so accurate thing, but it's enough for basic calculating of LF.
        <br /> Also you have to know many other characteristics and parameters of plane, so you can build it
        <br /> You can find more information <strong>

    <p>For now, that's all I'd like to share with you. 
    <br /> I'll be glad to make the upgrade of this blog
